Certainly! Here are some Node.js interview questions that are suitable for candidates with around 4 years of experience:

1. **Explain what Node.js is and how it differs from traditional server-side languages like PHP or Java.**

2. **What is the event loop in Node.js, and why is it important for asynchronous programming?**

3. **Discuss the concept of callback functions in Node.js. How does callback hell (callback pyramid) occur, and how can it be mitigated?**

4. **Explain the differences between blocking and non-blocking code in Node.js. Provide an example of each.**

5. **What are Promises in Node.js, and how do they help manage asynchronous operations? Compare Promises with callbacks.**

6. **How can you handle errors in Node.js applications? Explain the concept of error-first callback and how it's used in Node.js.**

7. **What is middleware in the context of Express.js? How does it work, and why is it essential in building web applications?**

8. **Discuss the purpose of npm (Node Package Manager) and how it helps manage dependencies in Node.js projects.**

9. **Explain the difference between the 'require' statement and the 'import' statement in Node.js. When should each be used?**

10. **Describe how you can create a simple HTTP server using the built-in 'http' module in Node.js.**

11. **What are Streams in Node.js? How do they help in managing large data sets efficiently? Provide examples of readable and writable streams.**

12. **What is clustering in Node.js, and how can you utilize it to take advantage of multiple CPU cores for improved performance?**

13. **Discuss the purpose of the 'Buffer' class in Node.js and how it's used for handling binary data.**

14. **Explain the concept of 'module.exports' and 'exports' in Node.js. How are they used to create reusable code?**

15. **Describe the purpose of the 'child_process' module in Node.js. How can you create and communicate with child processes?**

16. **What is garbage collection in Node.js, and how does it work? How can you optimize memory management in a Node.js application?**

17. **Discuss the concept of 'event emitters' in Node.js. Provide an example of how you can create and use custom event emitters.**

18. **What are WebSocket protocols, and how can you implement real-time communication using WebSockets in a Node.js application?**

19. **Explain what middleware is used for authentication and authorization in Express.js. How can you implement token-based authentication?**

20. **Discuss the benefits and challenges of using Node.js for building server-side applications compared to other languages and frameworks.**

These questions cover various aspects of Node.js, from its core concepts to its usage in building web applications and handling asynchronous programming. Candidates with around 4 years of experience should be able to provide comprehensive answers to these questions.
