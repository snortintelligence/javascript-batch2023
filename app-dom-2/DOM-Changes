Direct changes to the DOM typically happen when JavaScript code is used to modify the structure or content of HTML elements in a web page. These changes are usually triggered by JavaScript code execution in response to user interactions or other events.

Here are some common scenarios where direct changes to the DOM occur:

1. **User Interactions:** When a user interacts with a web page (e.g., clicks a button, submits a form, drags and drops elements), JavaScript can be used to modify the DOM in response to those actions.

2. **AJAX Requests:** When data is fetched from a server using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) or Fetch API, the JavaScript code can update the DOM with the retrieved data.

3. **Form Handling:** When a form is submitted, JavaScript can be used to process form data and update the DOM with the results or feedback.

4. **Dynamic Content:** JavaScript can dynamically create, append, or remove HTML elements from the DOM based on specific conditions or user actions.

5. **Animation:** JavaScript can be used to animate elements by changing their properties over time, which results in direct changes to the DOM for visual effects.

6. **Event Listeners:** JavaScript can attach event listeners to elements to respond to user interactions, and these event listeners can trigger changes to the DOM when the events occur.
